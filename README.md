===============

Flash remake of the popular screensaver. For more information related to the
original screensaver check:
<http://www.gnudawn2.talktalk.net/johnny/index.html>

Motivation
----------

Why remake this very very very old screensaver? Cause it is awesome and I'm
surely not the only person that would enjoy having Johnny once again as our
screensaver.

Objectives
----------

I plan this remake with 2 main objectives:

  * Reproduce original graphics and behaviour
      * Random scenes
      * Original pixel art
      * Original sounds
  * Upgrade and extend johnny's adventures
      * Improved graphics
      * New scenes and improve some original ones
      * New sounds and improve original ones
      * Correctly detect time of the day.
      * Add seasons

And many more things that I'm sure people will suggest or I will realize as
thedevelopment progresses.
